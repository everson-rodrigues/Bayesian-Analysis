# Bayesian-Analysis
This code uses the Bayesian statistics to look for a set of parameters for the dark matter.
Dark matter is believed to be one of the main constituents of Universe, with its total mass beeing greater than the massa of the visible matter (all that you see is just 5% of the universe).
In this code I use the package pymultinest to evaluate a Bayesian analysis looking for the most probable physical parameters that describes fermionic dark model. 

How that can be applied to business? Suppose you have a handfull of variables
